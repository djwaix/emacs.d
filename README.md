Decided to blow out my emacs config and start fresh.
Mostly, I'd jumped into emacs prior by cloning a colleague's .emacs.d and running with it. This worked great for getting up and going; however, I found that I missed out on many of the core understanding of how emacs works.

Most of what's here is residual from that foray into Emacs.

My Emacs is now setup, mostly, with a simple, single .emacs file.
